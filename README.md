# Movie_Recommender
## Project description
As a freelance Data Scientist, a customer approaches you with an ambitious request: she wants to take her DVD store online. And you thought all DVD stores were dead! Not quite: her store, called WBSFLIX, operates in a small town near Berlin and is still alive thanks to a loyal customer base that appreciates the local atmosphere and, more than anything, the personal recommendations of the owner, Ursula.

Ursula is realising that, as her customer base grows, it is difficult for her to find recommendations for each and every customer. With the move to an online store, recommending movies would be almost impossible. She thinks her store could have a design similar to another popular site for movies:

Each one of these rows of movies is a different recommendation system: some of them are more personalized than others. Your task in this project will be to create recommender systems that give users from WBSFLIX relevant content to watch.
